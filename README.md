## Ideas
soundtrak is a web based app where the users can input the title of any movie and the app will list all the songs associated with that movie.  

## User Stories
- As a user I would like to view music in movies so that I can keep up to date on what is happening in the world of movies and music.
- As a user I would like to leave comments so that other users can see my opinions
- As a user I would like to keep track of my favorite music in movies so that I can remember the songs and movies that I love
- As a user I would like to have a profile page that shows only my favorite movies and music so that I can revisit them again and again.
